# Seccomp

## Using RuntimeDefault as a seccomp profile
Seccomp (secure computing mode) is a security feature in the Linux kernel that can restrict the syscalls a process can make. It operates by defining a filter that dictates which syscalls are allowed and which are denied for a particular process or set of processes. Seccomp can operate in various modes, including:
- **SCMP_ACT_ALLOW:** Only explicitly allowed syscalls are permitted.
- **SCMP_ACT_ERRNO:** Specific syscalls are denied, and all others are allowed.

### What is the `RuntimeDefault` Seccomp Profile?

The `RuntimeDefault` seccomp profile is a predefined profile provided by container runtimes that enforces a standard set of syscall restrictions on containers. When a container is started with the `RuntimeDefault` profile, it inherits the default security settings defined by the container runtime.

**Key Features of `RuntimeDefault`:**
- **Predefined Security:** The `RuntimeDefault` profile includes a set of default rules that are designed to provide a reasonable balance between security and functionality.
- **No Need for Custom Profiles:** Using `RuntimeDefault` simplifies security management as users do not need to create and maintain custom seccomp profiles.
- **Consistent Across Environments:** The default settings are consistent across different environments, ensuring a baseline level of security.

### Why Use `RuntimeDefault`?

1. **Ease of Use:** Since it is a predefined profile, you do not need to create and manage custom seccomp profiles. This reduces the complexity of security configuration.
2. **Baseline Security:** It provides a default level of security that is suitable for many use cases, helping to protect containers from common syscall-related vulnerabilities.
3. **Compatibility:** It is designed to work seamlessly with most containerized applications, minimizing the risk of breaking functionality due to overly restrictive syscall policies.

### How to Apply the `RuntimeDefault` Profile

You can apply the `RuntimeDefault` seccomp profile to a Kubernetes Pod by specifying it in the pod's security context. Hereâ€™s an example of how to create a pod that uses the `RuntimeDefault` seccomp profile

Let's walk through a practical example of applying the `RuntimeDefault` seccomp profile in a Kubernetes workshop.

#### Steps:
1. **Create a Namespace for Seccomp Testing:**
    ```sh
    kubectl create namespace seccomp-test
    ```

2. **Create a Pod with the `RuntimeDefault` Seccomp Profile:**
    ```sh
    cat <<EOF > runtime-default-pod.yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: runtime-default-demo
      namespace: seccomp-test
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: runtime-default-demo
        image: busybox
        command: ["sh", "-c", "echo Hello from the runtime default seccomp demo; sleep 3600"]
        securityContext:
          seccompProfile:
            type: RuntimeDefault
    EOF
    ```

3. **Deploy the Pod:**
    Delpoy the pod using the following command
    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f runtime-default-pod.yaml
    ```
    output:
    ```
    pod/runtime-default-demo created
    ```
4. **Verify the Pod Status:**
    Verify that the pod is deployed and running
    ```sh
    kubectl get pods -n seccomp-test
    ```
    Output: 
    ```
    NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    runtime-default-demo   1/1     Running   0          5s
    ```
    
    Now, describe the pod to see the seccomp profile setting
    ```sh
    kubectl describe pod runtime-default-demo -n seccomp-test
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    Name:             runtime-default-demo
    Namespace:        seccomp-test
    Priority:         0
    Service Account:  default
    Node:             kind-worker/172.18.0.2

        Port:            <none>
        Host Port:       <none>
        SeccompProfile:  RuntimeDefault
        Command:
          sh
          -c
          echo Hello from the runtime default seccomp demo; sleep 3600
    ...
    ```

5. **Check the Logs of the Pod:**
    ```sh
    kubectl logs runtime-default-demo -n seccomp-test
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    Hello from the runtime default seccomp demo
    ```

6. **Exec into the Pod to Test Restricted Syscalls:**
    Lets test the seccomp feature by running a restricted call from the pod. First, exec into the pod using the followig command, 
    
    ```sh
    kubectl exec -it runtime-default-demo -n seccomp-test -- sh
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    / # 
    ```
    
    Run the following restricted command, 

    In simpler terms, the unshare -r command allows you to create a separate, isolated environment where you have root (administrator) privileges, but only within that isolated space
   
    ```sh
    unshare -r
    ```
    Output:
    
    ```
    / # unshare -r
    unshare: unshare(0x10000000): Operation not permitted
    ```

    More about `unshare -r` command,
   ```
     NAME
         unshare - run program in new namespaces
  
    SYNOPSIS
         unshare [options] [program [arguments]]
  
    DESCRIPTION
         The unshare command creates new namespaces (as specified by the command-line options described below) and then executes the specified program. If program is not given, then "${SHELL}" is run (default: /bin/sh).
  
         By default, a new namespace persists only as long as it has member processes. A new namespace can be made persistent even when it has no member processes by bind mounting /proc/pid/ns/type files to a filesystem path. A namespace that has
         been made persistent in this way can subsequently be entered with nsenter(1) even after the program terminates (except PID namespaces where a permanently running init process is required). Once a persistent namespace is no longer needed, it
         can be unpersisted by using umount(8) to remove the bind mount. See the EXAMPLES section for more details.
    OPTIONS
      -r, --map-root-user
             Run the program only after the current effective user and group IDs have been mapped to the superuser UID and GID in the newly created user namespace. This makes it possible to conveniently gain capabilities needed to manage various
             aspects of the newly created namespaces (such as configuring interfaces in the network namespace or mounting filesystems in the mount namespace) even when run unprivileged. As a mere convenience feature, it does not support more
             sophisticated use cases, such as mapping multiple ranges of UIDs and GIDs. This option implies --setgroups=deny and --user. This option is equivalent to --map-user=0 --map-group=0.

6. **Cleanup:**
```sh
 kubectl delete pod runtime-default-demo -n seccomp-test
```

```sh
    kubectl delete namespace seccomp-test
```
By following these steps, you can see how the `RuntimeDefault` seccomp profile helps in restricting certain syscalls, thus enhancing the security of your Kubernetes workloads. For further learning, you can explore this [tutorial](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/security/seccomp/).
